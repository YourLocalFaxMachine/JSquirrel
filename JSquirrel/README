-----------------------------------------------------
This library has not been heavily tested yet and it no where near a completed stage. That
said, some functionality is stable and Squirrel can be compiled and run. As far as testing
has shown, methods can be called and variables pushed and pop from the stack. Much more
should be possible, but only time and testing will tell.

This is not a stable release. As previously stated, very minimal testing has been done.
The current release of JSquirrel is simply so that the library can be tested in its current
stages before more in-depth updates are made.
